# CMPM 121 D3 Project

This project evolved from a static map into a complex, persistent geospatial game using three major architectural steps. We began by establishing the Core Grid System (D3.a/b), creating conversion functions (latLngToCellId and cellIdToLatLngBounds) to manage an absolute, earth-spanning grid. This structure enabled the Dynamic Drawing logic within the drawGrid function, which runs on the map.on("moveend") event. The next major step was Persistence and Memory (D3.c/d), where we implemented the Flyweight Pattern to save memory by only storing modified cell states (the Memento Pattern), and implemented localStorage via saveGame() and loadGame() to ensure all player progress persists across browser sessions. Finally, we introduced the Facade Pattern (D3.d) to manage player movement, creating the MovementController interface that allows the system to seamlessly switch between Button-based movement and real-world Geolocation (GPS) tracking, which fulfills all requirements for a fully functional, real-world mapping game.
